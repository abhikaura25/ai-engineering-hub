Cricket is a popular sport played between two teams of eleven players each, known for its blend of strategy, skill, and teamwork. The game is played on a circular or oval field with a rectangular pitch at the center. One team bats while the other bowls and fields. The batting team aims to score runs by hitting the ball and running between the wickets, while the bowling team tries to dismiss the batters by hitting the wickets, catching the ball, or other legal methods.

Cricket is played in multiple formats, including Test matches, One Day Internationals (ODIs), and Twenty20 (T20) games. Test cricket is the longest format, lasting up to five days and emphasizing patience and technique. ODIs and T20s are shorter and more fast-paced, focusing on aggressive batting and quick decision-making. Over the years, cricket has evolved with innovations like powerplays, technology-assisted umpiring, and data-driven strategies.

The sport enjoys massive popularity in countries such as India, Australia, England, Pakistan, and South Africa. Beyond competition, cricket often brings people together, creating a strong sense of national pride and sportsmanship.
